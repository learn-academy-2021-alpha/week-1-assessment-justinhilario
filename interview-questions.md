# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function at it's simplest can be considered a self-contained mini-program within one's code. Function's can act to perform many different acts on code and return a desired result.

  Researched answer: Functions encapsulate a task by combining many instructions into a single line of code. When a function is executed the program prioritizes the function and begins to execute the first line in the function. Functions allow programs to be conceived as sub-steps and allow re-usability of code. 



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() is a higher order built-in method for javascript which acts on arrays and acts on each value within the array to output an array with the same values, but in a modified state. .filter() is also a built-in method in which the program will decide on each value in an array and perform a built-in if/else statatement. Essentially, .map() will return a same-size, but modified array while .filter() returns an array of shorter length containing values that proved true to the built-in if/else statement.

  Researched answer: .map() is a method that creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The method allows items of an array to be manipulated, returning the conclusion of the manipulation in an entirely new array. In contrast, .filter() creates an array that holds elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. This is useful when a user needs to identify certain items in an array that share commonalities. 



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: Return is the output of a function, while console.log() is essentially a developer tool to observe the output of any given line of executable code. 

  Researched answer: console.log() is a function used to print information to the console. Return on the other hand is a call to pass some value back up to where the call was made. Although, they are both functionally different, a user can use both to fundamentally see if a function is working as expected.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: Arguments are values that are passed in a function and are the value in which the function defines the value of the parameters one defines in the function. 

  Researched answer: An argument is an independent item or variable which contains data or code. They are items that are passed between programs, subroutines, or functions. In this case, they are passed in as an input when called.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is when two software developers act to code in the same file, but with two seperate setups. One developer is at the keys coding in the text-editor while another developer is doing the high-level thinking and setting the direction for the assigenment. This is similar to the collaborative environment of a road rally in which the driver is at the wheels driving the car, while the passenger navigates the terrain and heads the driver to the correct direction.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile development technique in which one developer drives the code while the other developer reviews each line of code as it is typed. In this approach, the intention is to free the driver to focus on the nitty-gritty of the code, while the other focuses on guiding. The outcome of this method leads to grater workplace communication, faster task completion, and more accurate code.



6. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is when a condition is repeated or applied over a set of values and often takes the value of "i" in javascript.

  Researched answer: A set of instructions are repeated in a sequence a number of times or until a condition is met. The first case of this completion is called an iteration, and the repetition of this manner would entail a loop.



7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

  Your answer: Terminal commands are advantageous in the way that one is able to navigate their file system with a very small need for computer resources, as well as test code with the use of very little resources. A disadvantage is that terminal commands must be typed preciseley and have a learning-barrier for those coming from tradition graphical user interffaces.

  Researched answer: Terminal commands can be advantageous to those who are familiar with them in the sense that users can type in commands and quickly bring up what they need. Terminal commands also handle repeated tasks quickly and are less memory/graphical intensive. Disadventageous for terminal commands is that one must be familiar with how to navigate the interface  and that accuracy is important to executing commands succsessfully.



8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Team building challenges done in class were heklpful in the sense that they preppared our minds to start thinking like a developer. For students, who have never been in a computer programing class or have been out of school for a while, starting to understand the logic of the code is of upmost importance. The challenges allowed us to apply the same logical thinking we would need to complete our assignments, while also breaking down the walls of remote learning for the cohort to get to know each other.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- Jest 
  Jest is a JavaSctipt testing framework for creating, running, and structuring codes. Developer's primarily deploy this method in React frameworks. 

- Test Driven Development
Test-Driven Development refers to a style of programming in which coding, testing, and design are all tightly integrated. Essentially, tests are designed for every code functionality of an application and developers are only instructed to write new code if an automated test fails. 

- Classes
A class is a structure to create an object. It allows a porgrammer to create the parts of a program which are similar for two objects in the same class, essentially setting parameters that are common to objects of a type.

- React
React is a way to create reusable single page UIs using JavaScript. 

- React State
A built  in object where you store properties that belong to a compnent. Changing of the state, will re-render the components

- CRUD
- Create, read, update, and delete. They outline four basic functions that models should be able to perform. The naming of the functions literally imply what the desired function the program is expected to do.
